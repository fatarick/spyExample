# spyExample
Simple Spying Example on Python.

# How it works?

The program takes screenshot of your screen/s every 5 second and then saves it and then sends it to an FTP server (that you need to configure by yourself)

# What i think about if it doesn't work
The Screenshot works perfect but im don't sure about the FTP thing because i just took an example from StackOverflow.
